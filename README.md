# freetext

A LLM-guided feedback tool that guides freeform essay responses, for educational use.


## Installation

```bash
poetry install
```

Before you can use the server, you must either (1) change the assignment and response stores in `server.py` to run locally (e.g., JSON stores), or (2) update the AWS credentials in the `config.py` file. Note that no `config.py` is provided; **you must create a new file.** But we do provide a [`config.example.py`](freetext/config.example.py) file that you can use as a template. See that file for itemwise documentation of the configuration options.

## Usage

For development server usage (with live reloads), run:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn freetext.server:app --reload --port 9900
```

For production server usage, run:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn freetext.server:app --port 9900
```

## Examples

See the manuscript for examples.

The FreeText server will be hosted temporarily for public use at https://llm4edu.experiments.kordinglab.com/app, with an interactive example assignment available at https://llm4edu.experiments.kordinglab.com/app/assignments/1393754a-d80f-474d-bff7-b1fec36cdbb7. Educators may contact us at the correspondence email of this preprint for a token, which is required to create new questions on our public instance.

Our Jupyter Notebook Widget is available on GitHub at https://github.com/KordingLab/freetext-jupyter, and is powered by the FreeText Server, which can be found at https://github.com/KordingLab/llm4teach-freetext-server.

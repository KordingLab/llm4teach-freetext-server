Thinking about the important points that must be addressed in this question, provide a bulleted list of criteria that should be used to grade the student's response. These criteria should be specific and precise, and should be able to be applied to the student's response to determine a grade. You may include the criteria that were provided to the student if you agree with them, or you may modify them or replace them entirely.

In general, you should provide 3-5 criteria. You can provide fewer if you think that is appropriate.
